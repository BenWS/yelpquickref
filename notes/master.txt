- create 'No Results' page as catch for search #3
- Create link for the index page on the results page
- the parameters in this request seem to generate an invalid signature error:

"Invalid signature. Expected signature base string: GET&https%3A%2F%2Fapi.yelp.com%2Fv2%2Fsearch%2F&category_filter%3Dmovietheaters%26location%3D30506%26oauth_consumer_key%3Dc1hefHp0HHEJegsWH3zwlw%26oauth_nonce%3D148695316907600%26oauth_signature_method%3DHMAC-SHA1%26oauth_timestamp%3D1486953169%26oauth_token%3DGaeAzv0VANc4rKSh9ZulDExe-E8HwtoT%26oauth_version%3D1.0%26offset%3D0%26radius_filter%3D8000"

Need to reproduce with simpler version of program

I think a good fallback is 

1) to remove the requirement for the listed categories
2) remove radius requiremnent and mention this on the page
3) Return no results found, and then provide link to the index page for new query

- for locations being returned outside of radius limit set - the filter included was 'radius' when it should have been 'radius_filter'

-issue: troubleshoot 'body.businesses[0] is not defined' error, happens sporadically

To do:
- Create Pug files for each of the HTML files provided

 - I've built the skeleton of the first page (pure HTML, no Javascript). 
 - I've created a preliminary attraction list. Will use this in first test of the application.
 - category_filter isn't recognized as a parameter for the Yelp API. Will work around this by setting an artificial limit of 1000 on the application.
 - Return following data for each random venue generation:

Name
Image URL
Yelp URL
